Were your predictions right?
Mostly yes. I expected Wednesday to have the most screen time and Thursday to have the best focus, which matched the data.

What surprised you? 
I thought caffeine would boost my focus, but it looks like the days I had less caffeine were actually better for focus.

What was tricky or rewarding? 
The most rewarding part was seeing real patterns in the data I created. Correlating caffeine to focus took a bit of logic to set up, but it helped me understand how to work with arrays and averages.

How did using your own data change things?
It made the assignment feel more personal and engaging. I paid more attention to how I structured the data because it felt like it represented my real habits.
