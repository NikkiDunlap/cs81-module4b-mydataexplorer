Were your predictions right?
Yes, most of my predictions were accurate. I expected Wednesday to have the most screen time, and it did. I also thought Thursday would be my most focused day, which matched the data.

What surprised you?
What surprised me was how caffeine didnâ€™t seem to improve focus. I assumed higher caffeine intake would correlate with better focus, but the days with lower or no caffeine actually had stronger focus levels.

What was tricky or rewarding?
The most challenging part was figuring out how to compare caffeine intake to focus levels in a meaningful way. Creating separate arrays and averaging the focus scores took some thinking, but it felt rewarding once I got it working and saw a clear result.

How did using your own data change things?
Using my own data made the assignment more engaging. It felt less like a coding drill and more like exploring actual patterns in my habits. It helped me connect what I was learning to something real, which made it easier to stay focused.
